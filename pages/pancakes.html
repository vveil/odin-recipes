    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Everyone loves pancakes. They are may not as healthy as other breakfast
      options but they're far more yummy!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>250 g wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 pinches salt</li>
      <li>1 pck. vanillin sugar</li>
      <li>375 ml milk</li>
      <li>125 ml sparkling mineral water</li>
      <li>4 eggs (size M)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        Put flour with salt and vanillin sugar in a mixing bowl. Gradually stir
        in milk and water with a whisk to make a smooth batter. Add eggs and
        stir to combine. Let the dough rest for 20-30 min.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a little butter or cooking oil in a coated pan. Using a ladle, pour
        a little batter into the pan and swirl the pan to distribute the batter
        evenly. Bake the bottom side over medium heat for about 1-2 minutes,
        until the batter is no longer runny on the surface and the edges turn
        golden. Flip the pancake using a spatula and finish baking. Process the
        remaining batter in the same way, again adding a little butter or oil to
        the pan for each pancake.
