        <i>Everyone</i> ❤️ <i>pancakes</i>. They are maybe not as healthy as other breakfast
        options but they're far more yummy!
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>250 g wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 pinches salt</li>
        <li>1 pck. vanillin sugar</li>
        <li>375 ml milk</li>
        <li>125 ml sparkling mineral water</li>
        <li>4 eggs (size M)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put flour with salt and vanillin sugar in a mixing bowl. Gradually
          stir in milk and water with a whisk to make a smooth batter. Add eggs
          and stir to combine. Let the dough rest for 20-30 min.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a little butter or cooking oil in a coated pan. Using a ladle,
          pour a little batter into the pan and swirl the pan to distribute the
          batter evenly. Bake the bottom side over medium heat for about 1-2
          minutes, until the batter is no longer runny on the surface and the
          edges turn golden. Flip the pancake using a spatula and finish baking.
          Process the remaining batter in the same way, again adding a little
          butter or oil to the pan for each pancake.
